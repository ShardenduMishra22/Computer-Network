1.  **Introduction to the Internet**
    *   The "nuts and bolts" view: devices, hosts, packet switches, and communication links.[1]
    *   The "services" view: an infrastructure for applications like Web, video streaming, and e-commerce.[1]
    *   Internet standards bodies: IETF and RFCs.[1]

2.  **Protocols**
    *   Definition: Rules governing the format, order, and actions of message exchange.[1]
    *   Comparison of human and network protocols.[1]

3.  **The Network Edge**
    *   End systems: Hosts, clients, and servers (including data centers).[1]
    *   Access Networks: How end systems connect to the edge router.[1]
        *   Residential Access: DSL and Cable (HFC).[1]
        *   Institutional/Enterprise Access: Ethernet and WiFi.[1]
        *   Mobile Access: Wireless LANs (WiFi) and Wide-Area Cellular (4G/5G).[1]
    *   Physical Media: The physical links connecting devices.[1]
        *   Guided Media: Twisted-Pair Copper, Coaxial Cable, Fiber Optics.[1]
        *   Unguided Media: Wireless Radio (WiFi, cellular, satellite).[1]

4.  **The Network Core**
    *   Packet Switching: Breaking messages into packets and forwarding them.[1]
        *   Store-and-Forward mechanism.[1]
        *   Queuing delay and packet loss in router buffers.[1]
    *   Circuit Switching: Reserving dedicated end-to-end resources.[1]
        *   Multiplexing techniques: FDM and TDM.[1]
    *   Comparison: Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching.[1]
    *   Internet Structure: A "network of networks" connecting access ISPs, regional networks, content provider networks, and Tier-1 ISPs through Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).[1]

5.  **Network Performance**
    *   Loss: How packets are dropped when router buffers are full.[1]
    *   Delay: The four sources of packet delay.[1]
        *   Nodal Processing Delay.
        *   Queuing Delay.
        *   Transmission Delay.
        *   Propagation Delay.
    *   Throughput: The rate of successful bit transfer between sender and receiver.[1]

6.  **Network Security**
    *   Common Threats and Attacks.[1]
        *   Packet Sniffing.
        *   IP Spoofing (fake identity).
        *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
    *   Lines of Defense.[1]
        *   Authentication and Confidentiality.
        *   Integrity Checks.
        *   Access Restrictions and Firewalls.

7.  **Protocol Layers and Service Models**
    *   The concept of layering to manage network complexity.[1]
    *   The 5-Layer Internet Protocol Stack.[1]
        *   Application Layer (e.g., HTTP, SMTP).
        *   Transport Layer (e.g., TCP, UDP).
        *   Network Layer (e.g., IP).
        *   Link Layer (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi).
        *   Physical Layer.
    *   Encapsulation: How data is wrapped with headers at each layer.[1]
    *   The 7-Layer ISO/OSI Reference Model.[1]

8.  **History of the Internet**
    *   Early principles and the creation of ARPANET (1961-1972).[1]
    *   The emergence of internetworking and new networks (1972-1980).[1]
    *   Proliferation of new protocols (TCP/IP) and networks (1980-1990).[1]
    *   Commercialization, the Web, and new applications (1990s-2000s).[1]
    *   Modern era: Scale, mobility, cloud computing, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) (2005-Present).[1]
